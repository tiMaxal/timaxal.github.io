<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<p align="center">Stretching is part of the warmup routine to assist prevention of damage to the body during the more strenuous aspects of training. It not only increases ROM (range of movement), thereby improving one&#39;s capability in daily life, but also brings blood to the muscle to feed and cleanse it before (increasing muscular performance) and after (improving healing of the tissues) any physical activity.<br />
<br />
Daily stretching can be a pleasurable way to begin the day by preparing for activity, or end the day to help one relax in the evening.<br />
Each stretch is performed in concert with the Breath in order to obtain maximum benefit from the activity:<br />

<p align="center"><b><u><font size="5">Circling Warmups </font></u></b></p>
<br />
<p align="center"><font size="4">Possibly referable as a &#39;Western&#39; form of qigong, the following set of simple movements prepares the body for the motions of the <a href="#8gt">&#39;Eight Golden Treasures&#39;</a> exercise:</font></p>

<p class="StoryContentColor">Warmup (Circling, 3 x 2-way):</p>

<p>Stand with heels shoulder width apart and feet parallel (the line of the foot is taken as between the second and third toes to the centre of the heel).</p>

<p>Neck - Starting with chin on chest, roll the head right around its limit of motion very slowly in a complete circle and then slowly again back the other way. Now do the same at a slightly quicker pace each way, then finally twice fully around at a more rapid, though comfortable, speed in each direction.</p>

<p>Shoulders - Roll both shoulders simultaneously in one direction (either forward or back). Perform the action very slowly to feel the entire range of motion (ROM). To roll one way, first pull the shoulders gently down and ahead, lift them up the front and over the top (hunching into the neck), then pull them together behind as they slide down until separating to move under and into the starting position to continue the next loop. For the rotation in the opposite direction, start by pulling the shoulders down and back, clench them lightly before lifting them up behind and over; let them move slightly forward before allowing them to drop gently down in front and under to their beginning point. Move one way three times gradually gathering speed, relax and move slowly again in the opposite direction for three rotations.</p>

<p>Hips - With hands supporting the small of the back (over the kidneys), roll the hips in a horizontal circuit as wide as the feet are apart. One&#39;s hips should remain square to the front at all times, and the head ought to describe the opposite position of a similar circle at the same time. The weight in the feet needs to be in the foot opposite to the side one&#39;s head is leaning; accordingly, one needs to transfer the weight from side to side at midpoints in the circuit at front and rear.</p>

<p>Knees - Bringing the feet together, bend the knees and place the palms or fingertips lightly to each kneecap (this is for awareness only, not support!). Alternating the body&#39;s weight to each side, as if rolling under between the heels, create a horseshoe shape by moving the knees in an arc from one side to the other (open end of the horseshoe to the rear) three times each way. Be sure to keep the hips and shoulders square to the front; ensuring that one&#39;s balance is maintained above the supporting foot assists this. Do not lean on the knees with the hands.</p>

<p>Ankles - Now, balancing on one leg, rotate the ankle of the other in the air three times each direction. Straighten the leg and point the toes to the ground briefly, then the ball of the foot pointed to the ground and finally the heel, toes upward. Before changing legs, bend at the hips and lightly stretch the arms to the upward-pointing toes. Stand up straight again and repeat for the other leg.</p>

<p>Shake everything loosely for a minute or two, before preparing to begin qigong.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u><font size="5">Basic (Static) Stretching Routine</font></u></b></p>
<br />
This form is known as Static Stretching.<br />
<br />
-Breathe in while reaching to the position for stretching;<br />
-breathe out to settle into the position and commence stretching;<br />
-continue breathing in a deep, regular manner;<br />
-hold the stretch for at least 30 seconds (preferably a whole minute);<br />
-feel the stretch relax and lengthen while exhaling each time;<br />
-inhale while preparing to return from the stretch;<br />
-exhale to relax out of the stretch.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<p align="center">Never allow a burning pain to enter the stretch - this is doing more harm than good and should be avoided; stay with a warm &#39;tingly&#39; feeling, or nothing.</p>
<br />
<br />
Begin by standing erect, with the legs about two shoulder-widths apart:<br />
<br />
1. Bend to centre (calves = gastrocnemius / soleus; rear thighs = hamstrings; buttocks = gluteals);<br />
- keeping the knees straight to ensure the maximum effect in the back of the legs and the buttocks, bend first to the centre and try placing both hands flat on the ground. &nbsp;If at first unable to reach, do not force the stretch; only go as far as is comfortable, gradually allowing the ROM to increase with each repetition of the stretch.<br />
2. Bend to sides (inside thighs = hip adductors; outside thighs = tensor fascia latae, or &#39;TFL&#39;);<br />
- still keeping the knees straightened, move gently to one side and reach both<br />
hands to that foot, with the torso turned slightly to that side, or alternatively reach one hand overhead as the other reaches to the foot with torso square; hold for the length of time wished, then repeat for the other side.<br />
3. Arm across chest, thumb up (outside upper arm = triceps / coracobrachialis / lateral deltoid);<br />
- standing upright, hold one arm out straight, horizontally, and bring it across the chest with either an open or closed hand, but with the thumb upright;<br />
- support the arm with the other arm below it, just above the elbow and pull it toward the body lightly by bending the support arm upwards; swap arms and repeat.<br />
4. Arm across body, thumb down (rear arm / shoulder = triceps / posterior deltoid / subscapularis);<br />
- this time grasp the horizontal arm at the wrist with the other hand and bring it to the opposite hip (on the same side as the grasping hand), then change sides.<br />
5. Arm above behind (side &amp; under arm = triceps / latissimus dorsi);<br />
- reach and over the head with one arm, then bend it at the elbow to touch the back between the shoulder-blades (with the palm); grasp the elbow with the other hand (above the head) to hold the stretch in place, then change arms.<br />
6. Arm below behind (front of shoulder = pectorals / triceps / anterior and lateral deltoid);<br />
- this is a similar action to the previous stretch, except the back of the hand is reaching up behind to touch the back, held again at the elbow by the other hand, and then swapped.<br />
7. Balance, hold leg bent behind (front of leg = upper; quadriceps / lower; tibialis anterior);<br />
- now move onto one leg and steady the balance, before bending the other leg up behind; grasp the foot at the toes with the opposite hand and pull it lightly toward the buttock (on the same side as the hand), then swap legs;<br />
- now repeat, but holding the foot with the other hand; the foot should be in line with the lower leg, as if the toes were pointed.<br />

<p align="center"><b><u><font size="5">P.N.F. Stretching </font></u></b></p>
<br />
Proprioceptor Neuromuscular Facilitation (P.N.F.) stretches are the most effective way to quickly and safely gain flexibility. &nbsp;<br />
It is a simple technique using near maximal muscle contraction to assist a stretch.<br />
This is the &#39;Contract-Relax with Antagonist Contract (CRAC)&#39; form.<br />
<br />
In a normal static stretch, muscle spindle cells (the &#39;catch&#39; points of contraction) attached to the myofibrils (fibres of the muscle) are stretched along with the muscle fibres. &nbsp;<br />
When stretched, the spindle cells send information to the central nervous system, which in turn tells the muscle to stop stretching and effectively &#39;lock up&#39;. &nbsp;<br />
This is a mechanism to keep the muscle tissue from tearing, or overstretching the involved joint.<br />
<br />
A static stretch must be held for at least half a minute, perhaps even as long as a minute, before the spindle cells are disengaged to allow a deeper stretch.<br />
During P.N.F. an isometric contraction (one in a held position - no skeletal motion) followed by relaxation of the muscle to be stretched persuades the central nervous system, monitoring spindle-cell activity, that there is no danger of damage to muscle tissue in this activity; this allows the subsequent antagonist (opposing muscle-group) contraction to perform a far deeper stretch without having to wait the usual &#39;switch-off&#39; period.<br />
<br />
This works because:<br />
1. The isometric contraction, of the muscle to be stretched, warms and brings blood to the muscle;<br />
2. Thus the muscle to be stretched is mildly fatigued by the contraction and is better prepared to relax;<br />
3. Then an antagonistic muscle contraction allows the affected muscle to relax and stretch more. This works because as the antagonist muscle contracts, the spindle cells are disengaged in the muscle to be stretched. Without the inhibitory effect of the proprioceptors (spindle-cells) a much deeper stretch is achieved.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<p align="center">--------------------------</p>
Normally two people are required to perform correct P.N.F. stretching, but an individual alone can manage some stretches, enough for an overall workout.<br />
&nbsp;The following description assumes two people are working together, an athlete (A) and an assisting partner (P):<br />
<br />
1. Active stretch by &#39;A&#39; - this is a stretch, performed by the athlete on himself, using antagonist muscle(s) to obtain maximum R.o.M. (Range of Motion) with little discomfort (and no pain!);<br />
2. &#39;P&#39; blocks the return (never pushing, purely static) while &#39;A&#39; uses no more than 50% of muscle strength against &#39;P&#39; for 8 seconds;<br />
3. &#39;A&#39; relaxes and takes a deep breath in-out, with &#39;P&#39; maintaining position of stretching muscle to support and hold it there for 12 seconds;<br />
4. &#39;A&#39; now actively takes the original stretch further in the same R.o.M.;<br />
5. &#39;P&#39; blocks the return, with &#39;A&#39; using less than 50 strength against them, for another 8 seconds - this sets the new movement limit in that particular R.o.M.;<br />
6. &#39;A&#39; now relaxes, taking a deep breath in-out again and either finishes, or waits statically for 12 seconds before actively stretching (again if further increase of R.o.M. is desired or required).<br />
<br />
To practise P.N.F. stretches alone most actions can be performed with the assistance of a wall, doorway, table, tree or other inanimate, immobile object.<br />
When a partner would normally provide blocking assistance, one may need to be a little inventive to acquire a similar form of resistance or support.<br />
At times even one&#39;s own body can form the necessary aid.<br />
<br />
This entire regime of action can be summarised by the acronym C.R.A.C., which represents the sequence Contract (8), Relax (12), Antagonist &amp; Contract (8).<br />
Obviously, these are the actions of the person wishing to perform the stretching - the helper must fit around this pattern to assist them.<br />

<p align="center"><b><u><font size="7">Isometrics </font></u></b></p>
<br />
<br />
Isometric exercise is generally done in a stationary posture, exerting oneself against a solid object (such as a door/doorframe or a chair) or one&#39;s own body ..<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<p>Push from the feet, by &#39;sinking&#39; onto the heels, through the entire body into the fingertips and back down to the ground.</p>

<p>Keep the back straight and upright, with the tail rolled under (by unlocking the knees).</p>

<p>Hold each exercise position for approximately ten seconds, i.e. a slow count to ten (this forms one and a half minute sets: three sets with a half minute rest between each makes a five and a half minute routine)</p>

<p>These can be practised only once or twice a week, or as often in a day, daily, as desired.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<p align="center"><u>Isometric (doorframe) Exercises</u></p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<p>1. Arms stretched down, back of hands against sides of doorframe with fingers pointing down, pushing directly horizontally outward.<br />
<br />
2. Arms bent, hands at shoulder level with palms pushing directly outward.<br />
<br />
3. Upper arm horizontal, forearm raised so the hands are about head-height. Push upward at 45 degrees with palm out and fingers pointing up.<br />
<br />
4. Same position as (3) but pushing 45 degrees downward.<br />
<br />
5. Arms raised to place hands directly overhead, palm up and fingers pointing to each other. Push straight upward.<br />
<br />
6. Same position as for (5) but palm down, pushing upward.<br />
<br />
7. With the door shut, or the back against a wall, arms lowered and slightly bent, place the palms on the surface, &#39;sink&#39; onto the ground to push directly backward.<br />
<br />
8. As in (7) but with the arms straightened and back of the hand in contact with the surface to push backward.<br />
<br />
9. With arms overhead once more, place the backs of the hands against the surface and push directly backward.<br />
<br />
10. To extend the set by half a minute, repeat (7), (8) and (9) facing the door or wall.<br />
<br />
11. If there is a frame with an overhead &#39;lip&#39; to grasp, lift the body as if doing a chinup without leaving the ground. Use both palms facing forward and palms facing backward grips.<br />
<br />
<br />
While the rest of the exercises may be done as soft or as hard as desired, (7) through (10) should always be done gently, with subtle resistance from &#39;sinking&#39; onto the floor to generate power.<br />

<p align="center"><font size="7"><b><u>Kinetic Exercises</u></b></font></p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
&#39;Kinetic&#39; simply means &#39;in motion&#39;. &nbsp;This exercise routine is done with active movement, rather than the stationary form of Isometric Exercises.<br />
<br />
<u>The Set</u><br />
<br />
There are three or four exercises practiced in each &#39;Set&#39;. &nbsp;These are:<br />
1.Pushup -hands or fists placed on floor, beneath shoulders and a little wider; body is supported on arms and toes while held straight and raised and lowered with arms.<br />
2.Squat -standing with feet shoulder width or slightly more, toes splayed outward a little; body is held erect to lower and raise from standing to as close as possible to floor and back again.<br />
3.Crunch -lying flat on back with hands raised to ears but not holding on anywhere, feet and torso are raised one handspan (simultaneously), keeping legs straight, to balance briefly on buttocks before lowering again.<br />
4.Pull-up (optional) -placing hands either direction (forward, backward, or one of each) around an overhead bar (high enough to support toes off the ground at full stretch of arms), raise body with arms so chin passes height of bar before lowering to full arm-reach again.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<p align="center">(the fourth Exercise, the &#39;Pull-up&#39; is optional, as it requires the availabitity of the overhead bar.)</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<u>The Routine(s)</u><br />
<br />
To begin the Kinetic Routine, perform one of each Exercise in the Set. Then return to the beginning and do two of each Exercise in the Set (that is; two Pushups, then two Squats, followed by two Crunches, etc). &nbsp;Now do three Sets, followed by another two Sets and then one final Set.<br />
<br />
This is the &#39;Basic Routine&#39;, with Three-Set-Repetitions. Practice this twice weekly for at least three weeks before trying to increase the Set-Repetitions.<br />
<br />
When comfortable with this level of practice, extend the Routine, through the intervening Four-Set-Repetition, to Five-Sets in the final Repetition. The complete Routine includes stepping down the appropriate Repetitions, Four-Sets, Three, Two and One-Set.<br />
<br />
The Five-Set-Repetition is the &#39;Continuing Routine&#39;. Following a further three-week practice interval, it may be wished to begin ihe &#39;Intermediate Routine&#39;; this involves advancing to a Seven-Set-Repetition and back down the stages to One-Set.<br />
<br />
The next stage, when ready and able, is the &#39;Advanced Routine&#39;, containing all the stages through to a Nine-Set-Repetition and back to One-Set.<br />
<br />
Having completed three weeks on each of the previous routines, even beginning them daily instead of bi-weekly if desired, it is time for the &#39;Total Routine&#39;. &nbsp;The Total Routine is the sum of all Stage-Sets up to and including a Ten-Set-Repetition and then all Stage-Sets returning to One-Set.<br />
<br />
Never advance to the next level Set-Repetition Routine until quite able to complete the current level of exercise comfortably.<br />
<br />
Always perform the Circling <a href="#circling">Warmups</a> and a good <a href="#stretch">Stretch</a> Routine (preferably <a href="#pnf">P.N.F.</a>* stretching) to prepare properly prior to beginning the Kinetic-Exercise Routine and then follow it with the <a href="#static">Static-Stretch</a><a> Routine to finish. &nbsp;This will help avoid any injury and ensure you gain the maximum from your Exercise.<br />

<p align="center"><b><u><font size="5">Central Breathing </font></u></b><br />
<br />
This means returning to the form of breathing used as a baby or little child, into the belly.<br />
<br />
Standing in the qigong posture, maintain &#39;suspended headtop&#39; and fill from the ground up breathing into the Dan Tien*, which is located three fingers&#39; width below the navel and slightly to the rear of the middle of the body.<br />
<br />
Due to its position a little behind the centre of the body, as it expands the Dan Tien will swell backward (above the sacral area, effectively &#39;opening&#39; the rear of the hip joints), before the belly expands also (simultaneously opening the front of the hips and the &#39;quoi&#39;).<br />
<br />
The upper body will follow the lower closely, lagging only ever so slightly behind. The back should swell and expand between the shoulders during the minute interval from the rear hip joints opening, to the opening of the quoi. In other words, the Dan Tien expands not only back and forward but up and down as well, with an appropriately delayed response from the body and limbs to the wave-like expansion and following subsidence. As the rear of the shoulders fills to overflowing, feel the wave of expansion roll over the top to begin opening the front of the shoulders and hence the arms and hands.<br />
<br />
Once the arms are full and relaxing off the expansion, one should feel the remaining wave of energy (possibly felt as weight, solidity or warmth) settle into the bowl of the open hips, sinking comfortably a little &#39;deeper&#39; into the posture (deeper does not necessarily mean lower). The flow of energy (qi - &#39;chee&#39;**) follows a complete vertical circular cycle around the torso;<br />
<br />
&#39;In&#39; flows out from the front of the Dan Tien, down under (between the legs) past the perineum*** before moving up the spine and over the headtop to the top lip.<br />
<br />
&#39;Out&#39; returns from the bottom lip (joined to the upper lip point by the tongue-tip touching the roof of the mouth) down the front of the centre line until the qi flows into the Dan Tien again.<br />
<br />
*the dan tien is the theoretical energy centre, or &#39;store&#39;, for the body; it is slightly different in location to the physical centre.<br />
<br />
**Again conceptual, qi encapsulates the universal life-energy inherent in and throughout all things, especially living (which in mammals particularly may be construed as the bio-electromagnetic field of the body).<br />
<br />
***perineum - a point behind the testes or vulva, just forward of the anus, which sits at the lowest tip of the upright torso.<br />

<a name="meditbas"> The following ideas express the essence of meditative practise:<br />
<br />
&quot;See first with the mind, then with the eyes, and finally with the body and limbs.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Preparation:<br />
Meditation is an experience - theory is secondary;<br />
The more you do it, the more natural it becomes.<br />
Meditation can be done along with any activity.<br />
<br />
Place:<br />
The atmosphere of the place you choose can be very helpful, although you can do it almost anywhere;<br />
At first, find a quiet place to meditate - a room or even a certain corner in your house;<br />
Set up the area with a meditation pillow for sitting and a mat on which to lie down;<br />
Lighting should be subdued - &nbsp;not too dark or too bright.<br />
The most important consideration in choosing a place to meditate is that you feel at ease;<br />
Return to the same place each time for meditation;<br />
Habit and consistency help.<br />
Keep it simple.<br />
<br />
Nature can be inspirational for meditation -<br />
Meditation done outdoors, at a park, in the woods, or perhaps in a beautiful garden can help bring about a feeling of Oneness;<br />
Water can also have a calming effect -<br />
The beach, the shore of a lake, the edge of a pond, or the banks of a stream can all be possible sites for a meditation session.<br />
<br />
Often people choose to meditate with a group -<br />
Sometimes the commitment and momentum of many people embarking on meditation together can carry you along;<br />
Others prefer solitude and privacy, feeling that the group atmosphere is distracting.<br />
Whether you choose to meditate with others or alone is a matter of personal preference.<br />
<br />
<br />
Time:<br />
As short a period as one minute;<br />
A beginner can start off with one or two minutes a day and work up to a half-hour, but even ten minutes a day can be effective;<br />
The unconscious, inner mind does not function on clock time the way our conscious mind does.<br />
Start from where you are, devoting the time that you can comfortably fit within your schedule;<br />
Meditate at least one time nearly every day;<br />
You may discover a new capacity to use time.<br />
Be faithful to your practice;<br />
Meditate regularly!</a><br />

<p align="center"><b><u><font size="6">Zazen </font></u></b></p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<p align="center"><strong><font size="5">The state of &#39;Mind - No Mind&#39;.</font></strong></p>
<br />
<br />
There are four basic techniques, or perhaps &#39;stages&#39;, to achieving Zazen:<br />
<br />
1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Counting the Breaths</u> - this meditation is usually given to a student beginning. Either the inhalation or exhalation is counted from one to ten. If any thought other than the count arises, stop and go back to one. Some teachers say that the thoughts themselves are not a problem. It is possible to let the thoughts come and go without getting distracted by them (Hui-Neng, a Zen Master, called this steady attention &#39;non-abiding mind&#39;, meaning that the mind never gets stuck anywhere). So it is sometimes taught that as long as one can count from one to ten breaths without losing track then one may keep going;<br />
<br />
2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Following the Breaths</u> - a slightly more advanced practice. The student is now instructed to remain constantly aware of the breath without counting. In Zazen, the breath is always allowed to follow its natural rhythm, but as the practice progresses, it automatically becomes slower and deeper and more even. This produces a very pleasant sensation of lightness in the body and clarity in the mind;<br />
<br />
3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Shikan-Taza</u> - this is sometimes said to be the most difficult, most advanced type of Zazen. It is just Simply Sitting without any object of concentration. Sometimes it is begun by imagining oneself to be in the 360-degree Sphere of Awareness, but even that image must eventually be given up. Shikan-taza is often compared to the alertness of someone involved in a life or death situation (obviously an event considered possible by anyone living in Reality). Most important is to sit in the faith that this &#39;just sitting&#39; can and does naturally unfold to total Self-realisation (called &#39;Bhuddahood&#39;, or &#39;Enlightenment&#39;);<br />
<br />
4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Koans</u> - the documents of interaction between Zen Master and Student. The emphasis of the koan is always on the Ultimate Question, which can be stated as, &#39;Who am I?&#39; or, &#39;What is the Absolute?&#39;. Koans are a style of practice so uniquely Zen that the two are almost synonyms.<br />
The main task for a Zen Teacher is to awaken the Student to the presence of the Absolute. At the moment the Student is ready to actually open the eyes to the Truth, the Master would not hesitate to use any word, shout, or even deliver a blow to push the student over the edge. To this end, accept all sudden shocks, surprises, or even thoughts as what they are -opportunities to realise and experience the full sense of the Universe, known (if it must, or indeed can, be named) as the Absolute.<br />
It is said there are three essential qualities that enable one to solve the koan:<br />
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Faith<br />
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Determination<br />
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Doubt<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All that may be added to this is to have Great Patience, with oneself, others and the Universe.<br />
<br />
Apparently one of the most famous of all Zen koans is &#39;Joshu&#39;s Mu&#39; - a monk asked Joshu,<br />
&#39;Does a dog have Bhudda-nature?&#39;;<br />
Joshu answered, &#39;MU!&#39;. &nbsp;The monk was immediately enlightened.<br />

Placing corresponding fingertips gently together (thumb and thumb, fore and fore, through to little and little) to form a &#39;Ball&#39; between the hands; slowly begin deep, gentle breathing.</p>

<p><br />
When ready, softly bring the thumbs and little-fingers toward each other while inhaling.&nbsp; As they touch, combine left thumb-tip with left little-finger-tip and similarly the right, still touching left to right as well, to form the shape of the Infinity symbol.&nbsp; Gently separate the Infinite left from right beginning to exhale, keeping as near to a circle as possible formed by thumb and little-finger (making a &#39;Ring&#39;) on each side.&nbsp; Now take one complete cycle of breath, in and out, with the rest of the finger-tips still touching, left to right.</p>

<p><br />
Once more inhaling, bring the thumb and little-finger Rings back to touching each other left to right.&nbsp; Open them, returning to the original Ball as the breath is exhaled.&nbsp; Take another full cycle of breath, maintaining the Ball as it is done.</p>

<p><br />
Now repeat the same sequence on the next inhalation, except substitute the ring-finger in place of the little finger.&nbsp; Form the Infinite upon inhaling, then the two Rings during exhalation, allow one full cycle of breath, return to the infinite while inhaling and finally back to the Ball while exhaling again.&nbsp; Hold the Ball and allow another full breath cycle.&nbsp; Continue the sequence with the middle- and fore-fingers. &nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
When finished the Ball breath following the fore-finger Rings, recommence the pattern at the top with the fore-fingers, gradually down to the little-fingers again.</p>

<p><br />
Having finished one more breath cycle with the full Ball, gently bring all the thumb- and finger-tips together to form a three-dimensional Infinite similar to a dumb-bell, while inhaling, before separating left hand from right (still touching all tips on each hand) on the exhalation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finish by opening each hand during the final inhalation and relax the hands softly to the sides with the last exhalation.</p>

Introduction<br />
<br />
I pretend to understand nothing!<br />
<br />
I know many things and understand much, yet more is there which I do not.<br />
<br />
This I know and understand; learning and comprehension go on and are forever ..<br />
<br />
tiMaskal 17/11/97<br />

<a href="#contents">Perspective</a><br />
<br />
&#39;Birds and Bees&#39; are all very fine  .. but what about &#39;This is how the Universe works ..&#39;?<br />
<br />
<br />
All the ins and outs of the energy patterns of life: planetary phases, lunar cycles and the flow of the seasons;<br />
<br />
<br />
Whether it is realised or liked, or not, these activities influence Being, at every moment of existence. &nbsp;Hence the apparent ability of some to predict Life-flows from the patterns of astrological motion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="Direction"> </a><br />
<a href="#contents">Direction &amp; Empowerment</a><br />
<br />
It would seem that, if people are not helped to grow beyond major childhood problems or misunderstandings, the effect can cause gradual digression from Life to more childish behaviour than the offspring, thus perpetuating the cycle of confusion.<br />
<br />
The children then may have disrupted ideas of how to behave, emotionally ..<br />
<br />
The body and mind linkages of emotion are as an intimate jigsaw puzzle, which ends up the same picture by a slightly different manner each day, depending upon personal activities.<br />
<br />
Some sections slot together in a similar manner every time; others are reversed or even totally moved, according to whether the portions have been heavily affected (causing paradigm shift), during the day.<br />
<br />
When body or mind (or both) learn something new about survival (in any manner), once it is assimilated the jigsaw slots together that little easier ..<br />
<br />
The mind is, or should be, a balanced point of consciousness amid the maelstrom of brainial events; focused to empower the flashes of activity through the nervous system, releasing the power inherent and so driving flesh and bone to ever greater feats of strength, stamina, speed and relaxation.<br />
<br />
Mighty, is the Mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="Doing"> </a><br />
<br />
<a href="#contents">Doing</a><br />
<br />
Anything (new) must be done with focus to actually mean something; otherwise the time is wasted.<br />
<br />
To do hurriedly, or with little conviction, merely opposes the desired conditioning, negating the effort.<br />
<br />
Still, any remains better than none ..<br />
<br />
Never put off that which may be done now, until later.<br />
<br />
Unless, of course, it ought to be done later  .. procrastination is the mind&#39;s self-compensation for trying to rush things.<br />
<br />
You have to trust Self, or never know when to start; let alone when to stop.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="Wait"> </a><br />
<br />
<a href="#contents">The Relaxed Wait</a><br />
<br />
Breathe : tension the laxity of Spirit, then ease it out again to obtain relaxation.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All things come to they who prepare, in the waiting.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Having reached a plateau of accomplishment, it becomes then an achievement of itself not to rest in complacency and self-congratulation; but instead, to use the ensuing time to ponder the Path&#39;s direction for further development. &nbsp;Be constructive and use it (the wait) wisely, to always have some preparation for the next step, as well as to accomplish more from what you have.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="Searching"> </a><br />
<br />
<a href="#contents">Searching</a><br />
<br />
Emotional views and their expression are subject to exposure and perception.<br />
<br />
<br />
Knowledge and, therefore, ability are likewise reliant on these two principles: one internal (perception); the other external (exposure). &nbsp;Whether these are in quality, quantity, or both also affects the subsequent range (of emotional understanding).<br />
<br />
<br />
It is the search for the connection, between &#39;this-is-how-I-see-the World&#39; and &#39;this-is-how-I-interact-with-the-World&#39;, that is the path of Spirituality; enlightenment is attained once this &#39;boundary&#39; is surpassed, if the strength is available (internally) to make continuous and consistent use of the &#39;wisdom&#39; discovered.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wisdom stems from a balance between the positive and negative aspects of both thought and feeling.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="Humility"> </a><br />
<br />
<a href="#contents">Finding Humility</a><br />
<br />
Physical sight, or our trust in it, is the greatest hurdle (other than the fear of acceptance of death) to overcome if it is wished to be consciously free of this plane, as it is strongest physical human sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
Humility does not infer poverty, but proper care over use of wealth. &nbsp;Health allows, through proper humility, use of wealth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cultivate health and humility, then appropriate wealth (both physical and spiritual) accumulates.<br />
<br />
<br />
To have humility, you must first possess inner strength, obtained through growth ..<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="Pain"> </a><br />
<br />
<a href="#contents">Pain, Endurance &amp; Growth</a><br />
<br />
Unnecessary pain, either physical or emotional, is disliked, but pain catalyzes growth; therefore it would seem all pain is necessary.<br />
<br />
As growth happens only when it is opportune, no pain should be beyond anyone&#39;s scope (so long as previous &#39;growth&#39; was properly established by overcoming the relevant discomfort or pain).<br />
<br />
To ratify learning as viable reality, payment must be made through physical endurance. &nbsp;Extended time allows for mild levels of endurance. &nbsp;Lessen the time incurred and one then must accept increased endurance levels through necessary, appropriately assimilated, doses of pain ..<br />
<br />
Sometimes one must break the beautiful container, to obtain the treasure within;<br />
<br />
On breaking the container of the body to obtain the treasures of the mind, blood may be spilt ..<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="Blood"> </a><br />
<br />
<a href="#contents">. . . Blood; its Release</a><br />
<br />
<br />
If it is spilt, blood:<br />
<br />
-signifies that pain incurred may be seen as payment for growth taken, or instigation for that growth to be;<br />
<br />
-gives grounding in the awareness of mortality on this plane;<br />
<br />
-warns one to take precautions, physically and emotionally, against the acts or words of oneself as well as others;<br />
<br />
-finally, it is the epitomy of the strength inherent in continual flow.<br />
<br />
<br />
While shedding blood is an incredible, even portentious, occurrence for a male, females accept, or can at times become somewhat irritated about, shedding blood on a regular basis ..<br />
<br />
Is this what underlies the basic perceptive differences, which are so diametrically opposed, of the complementary racial dualities of Male and Female?<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="Strength"> </a><br />
<br />
<a href="#contents">Strength</a><br />
<br />
This is not weak -<br />
but only gentle;<br />
<br />
this is why the wish, sometimes, to cry ..<br />
finally, being sufficiently strong.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shit does happen; both good and bad.<br />
<br />
The good one may have to work for,<br />
but bad often just goes away -<br />
if there is strength enough to let it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="Challenge"> </a><br />
<br />
<a href="#contents">Self-challenge</a><br />
<br />
To use criticism:<br />
<br />
1 - acknowledge own &#39;shortcoming&#39;;<br />
(&#39;I am resisted/restricted, here:  ..&#39;)<br />
<br />
2 - describe own reason for action/position;<br />
(&#39;I  .. because  ..&#39;)<br />
<br />
3 - accept &#39;necessary change&#39; description;<br />
(&#39;I should/need to  ..&#39;)<br />
<br />
4 - adapt to change as required.<br />
(&#39;Therefore, I change to this:  ..&#39;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If something is annoying, look at its use;<br />
keep it while it remains useful,<br />
then leave it behind.<br />

<a name="Meditation"> </a><br />
<br />
<a href="#contents">Meditation</a><br />
<br />
In self-healing, once one has attained contact with the personal Source, it is then time to stop seeking one&#39;s own Utopia, in order to begin providing the path to others.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To achieve this, though, contact with the Source must be maintained perpetually, or one can feel self-persecuted by the helping of others, causing resentment and hence becoming detrimental to one&#39;s own work and health.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="Opine"> </a><br />
<br />
<a href="#contents">Opine or Judge</a><br />
<br />
Owning and expressing an opinion is a vital and defining action of who each is and is a good thing (though obviously, opinions held need not be outwardly expressed for definition of self and may indeed even be detrimental to others); but if this opinion is then forced upon another&#39;s, a judgement act has been perpetrated, which is not necessarily beneficial to either party ..<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There is surrendering to the Universe,<br />
which is good practice;<br />
<br />
But there is also succumbing to others&#39; pressure,<br />
which is perhaps not ..<br />
<br />
<br />
Be strong in Self.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="Opposites"> </a><br />
<br />
<a href="#contents">Opposites &amp; Balance</a><br />
<br />
While confidence can be mistaken for cockiness, pleasantness may also be misconstrued as condescension; likewise, awareness may be seen as arrogance, by some.<br />
<br />
<br />
Allow the right-mind into the left-mind and it (the right) can &#39;feel&#39; knowledge.<br />
Permit the left-mind within the right-mind and it will &#39;know&#39; feeling.<br />
<br />
This engenders Truth.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Work backward &#39;within&#39; to obtain the full strength of the Truth, in any Life-act studied.<br />
Subsequent &#39;happenings&#39; are consequently allowed the power to envisage (and withstand) the realization of any original act.<br />
Then resume moving forward through the intervening events, returning into current Life movement.<br />
<br />
<br />
Understanding the past<br />
enables perception of the possible future,<br />
allowing one to live Now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="Society"> </a><br />
<br />
<a href="#contents">Society (the &#39;Real World&#39;)</a><br />
<br />
Who says society should have the prevalent importance?<br />
<br />
More likely, it (society) should cater to individuals, in order to further Culture as the base of Civilisation.<br />
This is the position society serves in the short and long terms; not the inverse, where (society) is presently too often focussed on its own perpetuation, degrading individuals and civilised objectives.<br />
<br />
<br />
Money doesn&#39;t buy happiness, but it sure helps to have enough of it in such a world.<br />
<br />
<br />
Basic survival skills for modern living:<br />
<br />
-Personal hygiene (including domestic)<br />
-how to cook (with pyramid nutrition)<br />
-how to sew (patches, buttons and seams)<br />
-health perception (at least first aid)<br />
-meditative arts (physical self-discipline)<br />
-arithmetic, drawing, reading and writing<br />
-diplomacy (manners)<br />

People who make &#39;recreational&#39; use of psychoactive plants or drugs in search of Reality and understanding are often incredible people.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
However, to be a brilliant person, it is required of oneself to be &#39;straight-edge&#39;, or &#39;clean&#39;.<br />
<br />

Enlightenment is not found in illusion.<br />

The Real World is defined by labels;<br />

While the Real World is a construct of wishes,<br />
Reality is a construct of the senses.<br />
<br />
What is &#39;Real&#39;?<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;My body and I coexist, only because I wish to learn the lessons it has for me - else there is no reason for my being to happen on this plane (&#39;this plane- is the same as saying, &#39;this timed piece of the timeless all&#39;) and I would leave ..&quot;<br />

The ego maintains human inertia, namely &#39;habit&#39;, in order to perpetuate it&#39;s own laziness.<br />
While things remain familiar and constant, the ego need make no effort at assimilation, comprehension and appreciation, allowing it to simply enjoy itself (while inhibiting growth from unpredictable, new wonders - maintaining the &#39;comfort zone&#39;).<br />

<p align="center"><font size="5">The Essence of <a href="https://rayid.com/" target="_BLANK">RAYID</a> Iridology</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A form of iridology, developed by Denny Ray Johnson, designed to help analyse the construction/development of an individual&#39;s psyche.<br />
<br />
Designates four main divisions of the human persona, read in the iride construction:<br />
<br />
<br />
1 - Stream; the constitution density of the iris<br />
<br />
2 - Flower; petal-like openings between the iris fibres<br />
<br />
3 - Jewel; dark-coloured spots or marks on/in the iris<br />
<br />
4 - Shaker; contains all characteristics to some degree<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stream &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
- associated with the Body and kinesthetic (touch) awareness<br />
<br />
- does not like quick or illogical change<br />
<br />
- is the &#39;slow but steady wins the race&#39; type<br />
<br />
- has to learn acceptance of the new<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flower &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
- represents Emotional aspect of character (right-brain)<br />
<br />
- tends to be &#39;spacey&#39;<br />
<br />
- relates to creativity<br />
<br />
- needs to overcome difficulty remaining focussed<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jewel &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
- represents Mental activity (left-brain)<br />
<br />
- is logical, ordered &#39;thought&#39;<br />
<br />
- likes to control situation and action/direction<br />
<br />
- needs to learn to allow/flow<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaker &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
- is the combination of the other three aspects<br />
<br />
- creates change, motion and growth &#39; likes to push the limits<br />
<br />
- may be inclined more to either Flower or Jewel polarity<br />
<br />
- must learn moderation and balance<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interaction of the various Rayid types may be seen through an indeterminate variety of interpretations, since they are merely representative of the psyche complex.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once full understanding of oneself is achieved, there is also a state &#39;beyond the iris&#39; where one more deeply associates with the entire blend of identity, without needing to categorise specifics at any particular time.<br />

<p align="center"><u><b><font size="7">Herbs</font></b></u><br />
<br />
Herbal medicine can be a very simple way to allay basic ills and discomforts of the modern lifestyle.<br />
Most plants used medicinally are made as a tea, lightly steeped for five minutes with leaf or flowers and longer for roots [about fifteen minutes] .. usually best strained, then flavoured if desired with lemon and/or honey.<br />
Each is taken three times a day if being used as a medicine, during a period of two to three weeks.<br />
<br />
chamomile (relaxant/carminative) - to relax and as a mild sleeping aid for evenings. Also improves digestion.<br />
green tea (stimulant/diuretic) - a mild but effective pick-up (avoid in the evening).<br />
liquorice root (adrenal tonic) - when feeling drained from stress or over-exertion.<br />
nettle (non-caffeinated diuretic/mineral tonic) - to restore minerals in the body and cleanse lightly.<br />
<br />
Any of the culinary herbs used in the kitchen are of benefit to digestion. These include basil, marjoram, oregano, sage and thyme.<br />
Garlic, if one is comfortable with its aroma, is especially good for general health due to the cleansing nature of the constituents and the ease with which it can be added to foods. It can also help lower blood pressure. Do not cook it for more than twenty minutes.<br />
<br />
Some herbs are used in the form of the essential oil of the plant, such as lavender which is a good topical antiseptic and mild anaesthetic for stings but should not be used internally.<br />
It is also useful as an aromatic relaxant.</p>
